# PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using a combination of Illustrator and/or Photoshop, apply your brand to a **DIGITAL** interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, etc).

#### INTERFACE Wireframes    
Post on your class website in grayscale (includes black and white). 
* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white). 
* Every, single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text. Use Real Text.

#### INTERFACE Comps

* Create 3 different comps 
  * Comps is short for compositions
  * A composition is a photoshop or illustrator document that looks exactly like the final interface (color, type, etc.)
* if you're doing a website (3 DIFFERENT sets of home page and sub page pairs)
