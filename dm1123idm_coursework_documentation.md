# IDM COURSEWORK DOCUMENTATION
* You have a choice between wordpress and tumblr.
  * If you choose wordpress, set up your class website at http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~yourfirstnamelastname/vfs
* Add your coursework documentation URL to slack in the VFS channel.

We would like all students to document their IDM coursework on sites.bxmc.poly.edu. We want you to archive your work on sites.bxmc.poly.edu because these are IDM servers. If your work is archived on your personal servers, there is a possibility that you would delete your archives after you graduate or even sooner.

If you don’t already have server space, please email Elton Kwok, IDM Technology Director, eltonkwok@nyu.edu, MAGNET 883, to set up an appointment for space on sites.bxmc.poly.edu.
