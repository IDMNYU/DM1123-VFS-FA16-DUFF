# IDM COURSEWORK DOCUMENTATION
* You have a choice between wordpress and tumblr.
  * If you choose wordpress, set up your class website at http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu/~yourfirstnamelastname/vfs
* Add your coursework documentation URL to slack in the VFS channel.

Ideally, we would like all students to document their IDM coursework on sites.bxmc.poly.edu. We want you to archive your work on sites.bxmc.poly.edu because these are IDM servers. If your work is archived on your personal servers, there is a possibility that you would delete your archives after you graduate or even sooner.

If you don’t already have server space, please attend one of the group registrations for sites.bxmc.poly.edu with Elton Kwok, IDM's Technology Director, eltonkwok@nyu.edu, MAGNET 883.

Group registration for IDM server accounts will happen on the third Friday of each month throughout the semester.  Sessions will start at 1PM and end at 5PM.

* Friday September 23, room 811 at MAGNET
* Friday October 21, room 811 at MAGNET
* Friday November 18, room 811 at MAGNET

Please remember to bring your laptop with you when you visit a session.
