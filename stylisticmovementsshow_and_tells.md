### Stylistic Movements SHOW & TELL Directions
* Pair up w/ 1 classmate 
* Select a design movement during class
* An excellent starting point for research for some (not all movements) is [http://www.designishistory.com/home](http://www.designishistory.com/home) and obviously images.google.com
* Create an **8 minutes or less** presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.) that shows and discusses your design movement.
* Concentrate primarily on 2D but you can include 3D objects if you choose.
* Cite your sources.
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools)
  * Get familiar with your display preferences
* If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to **Crestron**.
