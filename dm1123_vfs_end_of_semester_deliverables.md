## <a href="dropbox">END OF SEMESTER DROPBOX LINK REQUIREMENTS</a> 

You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own dropbox link. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual dropbox folder.

Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:

Folders:
* 01 Logo–1st draft
* 02 Logo–2nd draft
* 03 Logo–Final
* 04 Interface–Wireframes
* 05 Interface–High Fidelity Prototypes
* 06 Interface–Final
* 07 Physical Application–1st draft
* 08 Physical Application–2nd draft
* 09 Physical Application–Final
* 10 End of Semester Book - 1st draft
* 11 End of Semester Book - 2nd draft
* 12 End of Semester Book - Final

All assignments should be native illustrator files (.ai), photoshop files (.psd), and indesign files (.indd)

Make sure that any type in illustrator has been converted to outlines or include the typeface(s) in the folder(s) instead.

Make sure that images are included if they are not embedded within illustrator.
